      present a positive version and perspective of negative thoughts entered by the user in the application. A different perspective on user's negative thoughts and frustrations can lead to decreased anxiety,
      happiness, lower stress and increased motivation. Shubhavi Arya is actively engaged in the GroupLensens lab pursuing research in the intersection between computer science, social computing and human-computer interaction.
      <br /><br />

She has used React Native, JavaScript and Expo to support the development of the mobile app 'Hearty Carrot'.
    The research study at this lab is one of the first studies investigating
  the utility and impact of calorie-tracking apps and to identify which features are maximally helpful and minimally harmful to people's behavioral and psychological health.
